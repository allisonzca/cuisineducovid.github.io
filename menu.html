	    					Here at CDC, we take pride in the dishes and experiences that we showcase for both our diners and our audience. With the experience “Storebought” our in house performance artist has created a performance meant to mimic that of a frantic shopper in a grocery store, who cannot find what they are searching for, due to mass panic buying in the stores. The pairing of this experience with a ramen based dish is meant to invoke the instant ramen consumed by the masses, while it has been elevated here to cater more to a refined palette.

	    					Dissonant Distancing
							With this meal and experience, we are hoping to exemplify the feeling of dissonance experienced by the “normal” people of the world when they see the posts on social media by celebrities and other wealthy people showcasing their extraordinary circumstances, such as quarantining in mansions, yachts, ski chalets, etc. but the dissonance they have between their circumstances and the messaging they are trying to send out to their fans and supporters. With this experience, our resident performing artist will seek to pinpoint exactly how the masses feel, and why they feel this way.

		    				<p>
		    					While the virus keeps us apart from each other, we have always made it through desperate times together. It is times like these which reflect the true nature of humanity. To represent the power of the collective even in isolation, Room 3's theme is "connection," representing the connections we share even in social isolation. In room three, guests dine with each other's silhouettes, which are projected on to the walls from six feet apart.
		    					While at first glance it seems a sad reminder of the effect of COVID-19 on once lively restaurants and bars, Room 3 also indicates that despite physical separations, we remain connected to each other through our shared experiences.
